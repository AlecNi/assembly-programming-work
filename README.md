it is a personal class homework repoitory for assembly programming

## 1. Learn how to use DOSBox & MASM tools

"helloworld!" to 8086

watching package 1st for more information

## 2. Nested loop & Use disassembly

print.asm/.exe file achieve the request of output (ascii character in low case, change line by 13)

query.asm/.exe file save the question learned during coding

loop.c file is the resource file write by c

loop.exe is compile by IDE

loop_nasm.asm/.exe file is disassemble/compile by objdump tools of gcc of mingw64

watching package 2nd for more information

## 3. sum & io

sum_reg.asm/.exe | sum_data.asm/.exe | sum_stk.asm/.exe 
file achieve the request of output
(sum from 1 to 100 and output with data in different place:register,datasegment,stack)

sum_register.asm/.exe file save the question learned during coding

sum_base.asm/.exe file is the demo and framework of jobs, which helps the coding after 

io.asm/.exe file achieve the request of input\output digits

sum.c file is the resource file write by c

sum.asm/.exe file is disassemble/compile by objdump tools of gcc of mingw64

watching package 3rd for more information
